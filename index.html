                        Being a village blacksmith is an artistic profession that involves a variety of tasks. As a
                        blacksmith, I have restored tools that are 200 years old and created everything from nails to
                        railings, hooks, and axes. I also offer 4 standard courses for individuals or groups of 4-6
                        people, which can be customized according to their requirements. However, the time and materials
                        required for each course may vary and can be discussed when booking. Whether you order a course
                        or a product, you will get to experience a cultural heritage that has remained largely unchanged
                        since the Iron Age arrived in Sweden around 550 AD.

                        My name is Fredrik Nordebo, and I received my training at the Sätergläntan Institute for Crafts
                        and Handicrafts. I now run a forge at home on the farm in the heart of the deep Hälsingland
                        forests. I manufacture everything from axes, stair railings, grave crosses, to interior objects
                        in a traditional way, using fire, hammer, and anvil.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My forge is located at Bogården, which is a courtyard forge at Bortegårn, a Hälsingegård that
                        was rebuilt after a large fire in the village in 1862. The fire happened on a Sunday, when it
                        was mandatory to attend church, and no one dared to defy the law to save their houses and
                        belongings. I am the second generation of my family living on the farm.
