### Existing Features

 All the pages are responsive

### Features Left to Implement

- The current website doesn't allow users to directly book a course, but they can send a request. It would be helpful to add a feature that allows them to view available dates for booking or reservation.

- Another feature to add is when a user clicks on the contact form that is located in the section special orders, the radio button is already selected by default when the user arrive at the contact form. Similarly, when a user clicks on any course from the main page, the radio button for courses and the specific course is also automatically selected.

- Currently, there are only three active sites on the website. Having a dedicated site for courses would make it easier for users to understand the contents of each course.

- By using javascript the contact from send a email to the owner with the input given in the form.


## Design
I started by creating a wireframe, which you can see below. Even though I already had some ideas about the color scheme and images for the website, I have included more detailed information about these choices in the Color and Images section.

### Wireframe
#### Home page
![Wirefram-image-homepage](assets/images/Wireframe-homepage-README.png)
#### Product page
![Wirefram-image-productspage](assets/images/WIrefram-products-README.png)
####  Contact page
![Wirefram-image-contactpage](assets/images/Wirefram-contact-README.png)
### Color
Blacksmithing is often considered a mysterious profession, so darker colors are usually preferred for websites related to this field. Looking at other blacksmith websites, it can be observed that a dark color is commonly used. The background color is a dark-brown shade (#3D261F), which is sampled from the apron in the Hero image. The white and orange colors used on the website are chosen using ColorSpace. [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%233D261F&sub=1).

![Colorpalette](assets/images/color-palette-README.webp)

### Images
- The website features a big banner as a hero image that aims to grab the user's attention right away. The image has a filter that creates a gradient effect, starting from the hammer blows and the sparks, and going up or down to the top or bottom of the picture. This gradient effect is used to make the image more visually appealing and to help the user quickly understand the purpose of the website.

- The images of the products are to give the user a feeling of the skills and precision of the company's work. This applies also in the image to the special order section.

## Testing 

  **1. Tested all the pages if they are responsive** <br>

- Heading levels are not missed or skipped to ensure the importance of content is relayed correctly to the end user
- All content is contained within landmarks to ensure ease of use for assistive technology, allowing the user to navigate by page regions
- All not textual content had alternative text or titles so descriptions are read out to screen readers
- HTML page lang attribute has been set
- Aria properties have been implemented correctly
- WCAG 2.1 Coding best practices being followed

### Bugs
#### Fixed Buges
- It was difficult to compress many of the received images due to their large size.

- An extra closing < /section > tag was removed from the Products page, which was causing an error that was found when running the W3C validator.


- The form can be submitted by the user without writing a message in the textarea. Although the bug has been fixed, the user can still submit the form by simply entering a dot. I'm unsure if there is a way to fix this issue.

#### Unfixed Buges

No Errors found
