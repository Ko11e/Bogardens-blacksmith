### Existing Features


### Features Left to Implement

- The current website doesn't allow users to directly book a course, but they can send a request. It would be helpful to add a feature that allows them to view available dates for booking or reservation.

- Another feature to add is when a user clicks on the contact form that is located in the section special orders, the radio button is already selected by default when the user arrive at the contact form. Similarly, when a user clicks on any course from the main page, the radio button for courses and the specific course is also automatically selected.

- Currently, there are only three active sites on the website. Having a dedicated site for courses would make it easier for users to understand the contents of each course.

- By using javascript the contact from send a email to the owner with a infomation and the message given in the form
