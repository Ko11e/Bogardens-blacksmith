### Existing Features
 All the pages are responsive


### Features Left to Implement

- The current website doesn't allow users to directly book a course, but they can send a request. It would be helpful to add a feature that allows them to view available dates for booking or reservation.

- Another feature to add is when a user clicks on the contact form that is located in the section special orders, the radio button is already selected by default when the user arrive at the contact form. Similarly, when a user clicks on any course from the main page, the radio button for courses and the specific course is also automatically selected.

- Currently, there are only three active sites on the website. Having a dedicated site for courses would make it easier for users to understand the contents of each course.

- By using javascript the contact from send a email to the owner with a infomation and the message given in the form


## Design
 I started with making a wirefram as can be see below. Altought the color team and the images of the website was already in the back of my mind. In the section colors and images is it more infromation on the color and image choices.

### Wireframe
#### Home page

#### Product page

####  Contact page

### Color
Since Balcksmith usally a mysterius feeling the darkerteam feelt lika the right choice and looking at other blacksmith site a darkercolor is usally used. The darkbrown color (#3D261F), the background color, is sampeld for the apron in the Hero image. The white and the orange is found using a website [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%233D261F&sub=1).

### Images
- The site contains a larger baner as a hero image to immediately capture the attention of the user. Over the image is a filter with a gradient from the hammer blows, and the sparks, to the top or the bottom of the image. The gradient is appyed to make the picture more eye catching and for the user the qiukly understand the content of the website.

- In the section about the smithy two photos are shown to the owner and the farm. Because its a one man company showing a picture of the owner 

- The images of the products is to give the user a feeling of the skille and presition in the companys work. This applys also in the image to the special order section.
